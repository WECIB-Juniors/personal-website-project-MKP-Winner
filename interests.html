      <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gardening:</strong> To take my eyes off the screen, I usually enjoy gardening outside and embracing the beauty of nature. I particularly enjoy growing my own vegetables, which gives me a sense of accomplishment. The process of nurturing plants from seeds to full growth teaches me patience and dedication, skills that translate well into my professional life.</li>
        <li><strong>Watching Movies:</strong> I really enjoy watching and exploring different types of movies, which inspires me to make different games using storylines. Science fiction and fantasy genres are my favorites as they spark my creativity and imagination. I often analyze plot structures and character development to incorporate similar storytelling elements in my game designs.</li>
        <li><strong>Photography:</strong> I love capturing creative perspectives, which inspires my visual design approach in web development. I specialize in landscape and architectural photography, always looking for unique angles and compositions. These photography skills help me better understand visual hierarchy and balance in my web designs.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming:</strong> I love to play strategy-based games that help me sharpen my focus and logical thinking abilities. My favorite games include chess and real-time strategy games that require careful resource management. I often participate in online gaming communities where I can discuss strategies and learn from other players.</li>
        <li><strong>Music:</strong> Listening to instrumental music helps me concentrate and unwind after long coding sessions. I particularly enjoy classical and electronic genres that create the perfect atmosphere for problem-solving. I've also created several coding playlists that help me maintain a productive workflow throughout the day.</li>
